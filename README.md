# Room8's Apartment Management System

Web application designed to help residents of shared apartments manage chores and expenses. It provides both RESTful APIs and web interfaces for owners and tenants.  
The entire application is built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf



### Features

- **Apartment Registration:** Owners can create and manage apartments. Tenants can join apartments using a reference code.
- **User Roles:** Supports Owner and Tenant roles with different permissions and dashboards.
- **Chore Management:** Assign, schedule, and track chores. Chores can be recurring and have statuses (e.g., pending, completed).
- **Expense Tracking:** Log shared expenses, split costs among residents, and track transactions and balances.
- **Debt Simplification:** Automatically simplifies debts between users to minimize transactions.
- **Authentication & Security:** Secure login and role-based access control using Spring Security.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error pages for common HTTP errors (403, 404, 500).
